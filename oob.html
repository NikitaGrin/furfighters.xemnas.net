    <h1>Out of Bounds</h1>
    Now it's one thing to keep a model out of view from the player - They're likely there to save on loading times,
    especially when they're used within the level. But items? That's another story.<br />There's a whole load of items
    that are hidden from the player's view, and unobtainable through normal gameplay. These are all likely put there by
    mistake. But hidden Telepoints? Hidden models that don't get used anywhere in any cutscene? Well, take a look for
    yourself. These are primarily from <b>Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge</b>, but some of them can also be found in the
    same location in other versions of the game too (and this will be stated if so).<br /><br />
