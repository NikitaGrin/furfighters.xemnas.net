    <h1>Enemies</h1>
    Along your journey, you'll meet many different enemies. Here are the standard enemies you'll find in the game. And
    remember - If their weapons hit each other instead of your Fur Fighter, you'll start a fight between them.
    <b>Warning:</b> The final enemy could be classified as a spoiler. Once you've seen the Gronda, stop reading if this
    bothers you.
    <h2>Bears</h2>
    <img src="img/bluebear.png" title="Blue Bear" alt="Blue Bear" align="left">
    <h3>Blue Bear</h3>The very first enemy you will encounter during actual gameplay, Blue Bears (sometimes referred to
    as Little Bears, Grizzly Bears or Black Bears) hold only a pistol (which costs 4HP when it hits) and have a fairly
    slow movement. However, they are almost always found in groups, or hanging around other enemies for backup. Whilst
    common in earlier levels, they become more uncommon as you progress through the game. <br /><br /><br />
    <img src="img/brownbear.png" title="Brown Bear" alt="Brown Bear" align="left">
    <h3>Brown Bear</h3>What is arguably the most common enemy in the whole game, Brown Bears can be found in almost
    every level and hubworld. They always carry a Shotgun with them, which only fires one bullet (which takes away 9HP
    at a time). They are a bit larger and have more health than the Blue Bears too. They aren't always seen in groups,
    though often have at least one compadre nearby. Juliette is tasked with defeating 100 Bears in Secret Island, and 90
    of them are Brown Bears.<br /><br /><br />

    <img src="img/polarbear.png" title="Polar Bear" alt="Polar Bear" align="left">
    <h3>Polar Bear</h3>The largest of the bears, the Polar Bear carries a Submachine Gun with him, has the most health
    and is the fastest of the bears. These Bears can be seen with a variety of different allies, or sometimes even just
    patrol areas on their lonesome. One of them is even blocking the 'secret' elevator in the World Quack Centre. The
    best way to take one out is by fighting fire with fire, or in this case, choose a fast firing weapon to counter
    their Submachine Gun. Something worth noting about the Polar Bears is that they are immune to any attacks from the
    Freeze Gun (for obvious reasons, I suppose).<br /><br /><BR />
    <img src="img/panda.png" title="Panda Bear" alt="Panda Bear" align="left">
    <h3>Panda Bear</h3>The Panda Bear is an enemy found exclusively in Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge. This unique bear
    doesn't hold a gun at all - Instead, he throws Grenades at his opponent. And promptly runs away from them too. In
    fact, sometimes they run a little too far. The best example here is the Panda Bear in God Machine Valley, who often
    runs off the edge to his doom (even if the grenade exploded a few seconds beforehand). These guys are a pain when in
    groups, since Grenades can cause a lot of damage when they hit. Oh, and by the way - when defeated, a live Grenade
    will fall from their paws and explode after a short while.<br /><BR />


    <h2>Other Minions</h2>
    <img src="img/peacock.png" title="Peacock" alt="Peacock" align="left">
    <h3>Peacock</h3>Peacocks are fairly common enemies, using a Rocket Launcher to fire a Rocket at any Fur Fighters
    within their sight range... Which is pretty far. Their Rocket Launchers recharge fairly quickly, so get ready to
    move out of the way almost as soon as they fan their tails out at you. They're about as fast as a Brown Bear, but
    don't like them get too close - Their pecking attack can wipe any Fur Fighter out within seconds. It's advisable to
    take these out before any other nearby enemies. However, Peacocks are known for shooting allies by mistake should
    they be too close to you. Use this to your advantage.<br /><br /><br /><br />

    <img src="img/croc.png" title="Crocodile" alt="Crocodile" align="left">
    <h3>Crocodile</h3>These fast biters might not have a gun, but they make up for it with high speed, high health and a
    high damage bite attack. They're often seen with other Crocodiles, so expect to run around like a mad man (or woman,
    if you're playing as Juliette) as one of them tries to bite your Fur Fighter whilst you're trying to fluff his
    companion. They're also adept swimmers on the surface, so expect them to chase you and chow down if you're not
    careful. It's very difficult to perform a OHKO on these guys, so make sure you have one of your fastest weapons on
    standby.<br /><br /><br /><br />

    <img src="img/cow.png" title="Cow" alt="Cow" align="left">
    <h3>Cow</h3>Just like the Panda Bear, these firey opponents can only be seen in Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge. They
    hover just above ground, making them the only aerial enemies. And yes, they'll gladly scale new heights to reach a
    Fur Fighter high above. They use a Flamethrower weapon (also exclusive to Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge) which
    constantly fires out a stream of, well, fire. Once defeated, they will explode momentarily, damaging anyone nearby.
    Sometimes this happens mid-air, sometimes they fall to the ground.<br /><br />

    <img src="img/armadillo.png" title="Armadillo" alt="Armadillo" align="left">
    <h3>Armadillo</h3>These guys are one of the tougher enemies you'll come across. The Armadillos can hide in their
    shell as they move around, making them invincible to other attacks. You can only attack them whilst they're firing
    back at you using their Heavy Machine Gun or their fist. Since they have that shell of theirs, they can also hide
    from the Seeker Launcher Rockets. Finally, be warned - These are the only enemies that you can't attack until they
    see <i>you</i>. No idea why.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <img src="img/shrimp.png" title="Giant Shrimp" alt="Giant Shrimp" align="left">
    <h3>Giant Shrimp</h3>Giant Shrimps, also known as just Shrimps or Lobsters, are the only enemy fully capable of
    swimming underwater. Unlike Rico, however, these guys can fight back with their pincers whilst under the sea, and
    getting caught between a couple of them can deplete health fairly rapidly. Their own health is pretty high too, but
    at least they're no faster than a regular Bear. They use an Auto Shotgun when out of the water, but when you defeat
    them, you'll be given a Shotgun. What a gip.<br /><br />

    <img src="img/fox.png" title="Fox" alt="Fox" align="left">
    <h3>Fox</h3>Whilst not as speedy as the Crocodile, the Foxes still hold more speed than a Bear and since they wield
    two Pistols (for the record, you'll only get one of them when they're defeated), their gun fire speed is that of a
    Submachine Gun. They have a good amount of health too. Most of the time these furry foes hang around other enemies,
    often acting as a diversion of sorts. They're one of the only enemies that lack a close attack, but this isn't
    particularly helpful, since it just gives them less reason to slow down when they're approaching you.<br /><br />

    <img src="img/chameleon.png" title="Chameleon" alt="Chameleon" align="left">
    <h3>Chameleon</h3>Chameleons can be tricky little buggers. As you can probably guess, they can blend in with their
    surroundings. So well, in fact, that they become completely invisible. They only show their true colors when their
    ready to lash out with their long tongues, which does more damage than you would expect it to. They can hit from a
    pretty far distance, and whilst their usually alone, catching them in pairs or amongst other enemies can prove to be
    a hassle. In Viggo A Gogo, however, their yellow builder's hat never turns invisible, giving you the
    upperhand.<br /><br />

    <img src="img/gronda.png" title="Gronda" alt="Gronda" align="left">
    <h3>Gronda</h3>The Grondas, sometimes known as Snapdragons, are some of the most notorius enemies found in the game.
    Why? Because for a long time, no one knew how to defeat them. To make matters worse, the Official Strategy Guide
    lists them as 'Invincible'. But that didn't stop Fur Fighter fans finding out their secret. Grondas attack by
    reaching down and quickly chomping on the Fur Fighters. The damage is rapidly depleted by however long they touch
    the Gronda. To defeat them, you need to fire a Grenade (or three) when their mouth is open. After several hits, they
    will fall.<br /><br /><br />

    <img src="img/viggoclone.png" title="Viggo Clone" alt="Viggo Clone" align="left">
    <h3>Viggo Clone</h3>You'll only be encountering these guys in the final battle, so look away from this text now if
    you don't want to be spoilt! Well, fair enough, you may have already been spoilt. Sorry about that. Didn't you read
    the warning at the top of the page? Anyhow, Viggo Clone is basically Polar Bear 2. The only difference besides their
    appearance is that they <i>can</i> be frozen. That's it. They will constantly regenerate until the 6 Fuse Boxes have
    been destroyed, so don't spend too much of your time destroying them, since they come back fairly promptly and
    they're very quick to spot you, even from a distance. It's hard to lure them together away from you for the rest of
    the battle as a result. Take them down how you would any other enemy. Freezing is probably a good solution, since it
    might also buy you some time (until another Clone shoots the frozen one, of course).<br /><br />
