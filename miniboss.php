        <h1>Mini Bosses</h1>
You've got your <a href="enemies.php">standard enemies</a>, your <a href="boss.php">big bosses</a>... But what about those in-between villains?<br /><br />

<h2>Quackenheim Museum, New Quack City</h2>
<a name="statue"><img src="img/statue.png" title="Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time" alt="Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time" align="left"><h3>Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time</h3></a>...Let's just call this thing 'Statue to Catching New Players Offguard'. No? Okay. This is the likely to be first Chameleon Bot you'll encounter in the game, found in the Quackenheim Museum. After obtaining the Coat Ticket and attempting to exit to anywhere from the main room, the doors will suddenly close and this thing will come to life. Like all Chameleon Bots (and as General Bristol will explain to you), the only weak spot is it's eye. Leave a large gap between you both, enough for you to shoot the eye without needing to move your weapon too much. Start running around in the statue to avoid as many of the gun shots as possible. These are almost relentless, so hopefully you've adjusted yourself to reach his eye. Fire at it and the Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time goes a little haywire whilst it adjusts itself, shooting into thin air before finally regaining focus on the Fur Fighter. You'll then need to continue running to dodge some more bullets as it raises its head and the eye becomes visible again. I would recommend a Shotgun for this, since his damage is based on health as opposed to hits (like any other enemy in this game). There's also a Meerkat Multiple near one of the small pools for those still struggling. Eventually, you'll blow the head off and the doors will re-open.<br /><BR />

<h2>Beaver Dam, Beaver Power</h2>
<a name="robot"><img src="img/robottrans.png" title="Robot Transformer" alt="Robot Transformer" align="left"><h3>Robot Transformer</h3></a>If you're going through the levels in order, there's a good chance you know what to expect from this Chameleon Bot. If not, your encounter with the Robot Transformer in Beaver Dam might not be as smooth as it should be. Well, even then, there's a chance it won't go so smoothly, because unlike the Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time, this Bot is positioned in a smaller room on a small platform surrounded by water. Electrically charged water, that is. There are other platforms here too, which you'll probably be using. After rescuing Fweek, the doors will shut and the charger towards the middle of the room will rear its face. There's two ways you can defeat this mini boss. The first, is to quite simply use the same techniques as you used on the Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time. Hop onto the other platforms, constantly moving and shooting the eye whenever it's ready. The other is to simply stand your ground. No, really - Just shoot the eye (again, a strong weapon is  recommended) and wait for it to bring its head up again. This way, however, will mean you're likely going to lose health since there's always an extended wait for the eye to show. Don't fear - Hiding under that stairway to your left is a can of Pet Yums. When low on health, you can traverse across the water (quickly though, as it still depletes health) and return to the platform to finish it off. Once defeated, the doors open to the pipe room.  <br /><BR />

<h2>Space Station Meer, Cape Canardo</h2>
<a name="31st"><img src="img/31st.png" title="31st Century Fox" alt="31st Century Fox" align="left"><h3>31st Century Fox</h3></a>Found in one of the many compartments of the Space Station Meer, this giant Fox complains about a copyright issue with the alien shown just beforehand. When the Fur Fighters dispute that claim, 31st Century Fox leaps into action. Well, this mini boss is very straight forward, because... Well, he's identical in gameplay to any other Fox in the game. He's just larger and has an incredible amount of health. Make use of the nearby ammo, you're gonna need it. This guy can easily withstand a fully loaded Plasma Beamer attack. On the plus side though, just like his relatives, he takes a good delay when hit, which can be used to your advantage. Since Space Station Meer has such a unique gravitational pull, you can also fire him into the wall and into the air with a well positioned Plasma Beamer shot. The room you're left in with him is pretty big and you can move freely around it, so if you've made it this far into the game, you shouldn't have too much trouble bringing him down. But I'll stress again - He has a tremendous amount of health. But due to his speed, avoid using weapons like the Rocket Launcher or Grenade Launcher (unless he's right on top of you, in which case, fire away). Seeker Launchers are still good to go. Once defeated, the doors will re-open and you can continue on your journey.<br /><br /><br />

<h2>Dinos Upstairs, Dinotopolis</h2>
<img src="img/mrdustee.png" title="Mr. Dustee" alt="Mr. Dustee" align="left"><h3>Mr. Dustee</h3><i>Hello! I'm Mr. Dustee.</i> Ah, for anyone playing the regular Fur Fighters, that one line is so memorable. <i>Because it's the only real line spoken in the game.</i> Anyway, enough nostalgic trivia! This here is Viggo Industries' state of the art Vacuum Cleaner, and it's not interested in destroying the Fur Fighters in Dinos Upstairs. No, this mechanical masterpiece is interested in cleaning the carpet. And the Fur Fighters are on the carpet. Ah. Well, hopefully you haven't skipped over the other Chameleon Bots and by now you should have a good idea on the overall objective - Shoot the eyes. Now, the thing with this mini boss is that whilst the room is a good size and there's a shelf to hide under, Mr. Dustee itself (himself?) has no gun. No, this Bot uses a constant suction to suck you up to the mouth, where your health is drained rapidly just by touching the top of the suction nozzle. You can still escape by moving away from the Bot, but sometimes this can still prove to be difficult. Be warned - On some rare occasions, the suction becomes so powerful you can't get away (and if you've got Invulnerability on, expect to restart the level). To add to the difficulty, Mr. Dustee is constantly moving around and following your Fur Fighter. As with the Statue To Continuous Forms Of Uniqueness In Time, constant movement can help to ensure this machine is put out of service. Once this has been done, you can continue to the Dino Boy's bedroom.
<br /><br /><br />
<h2>H.M.S. Viggolina, Viggo A Gogo</h2>
<img src="img/harrier.png" title="Viggo Industries MK Harrier III" alt="Viggo Industries MK Harrier III" align="left"><h3>Viggo Industries MK Harrier III</h3>Three of these aircrafts can be found on the H.M.S. Viggolina, and all require you to step out via a thin door to reach them. Once outside, they'll pop up and you'll be notified of their presence, giving you time to dodge the first blasts from them. Polar Bears operate the aircrafts, which use two guns which act like Submachine Guns. They're fairly easy to vanquish, luckily - On your left and right you have a selection of ammo and Pet Yums if you're feeling low, and these constantly regenerate. Move left and right, firing at him like there's no tomorrow (perhaps with the weapon that corresponds to the ammo left for you) and he'll go down. If you're playing Fur Fighters: Viggo on Glass, you needn't worry about destroying these if you don't want to since the amount of aircrafts you need to destroy have been lowered, but in all other versions, you'll have to track down and destroy all three.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<h2>Secret Island, Viggo A Gogo</h2>

<img src="img/uber.png" title="Uber Bear" alt="Uber Bear" align="left"><h3>Uber Bear</h3>General Viggo's loyal bear bodyguard is the first of 4 subsequent mini bosses. How fun! Anyway, this guy has a time limit to be defeated - 60 seconds, to be precise. If you lose in this or any of the next battles, don't worry too much - You'll start off with the last enemy you failed to defeat (in other words, don't panic for letting Oddfelt win - You'll have your revenge). Anyway, this guy is incredibly straight forward - He acts just like a Polar Bear with more health. Try to push him up against a cage wall and fire constantly at him - If you've done it right, he'll be trapped and you'll soon be snatching the key he was protecting and moving on to the next mini boss, who happens to be quite familiar...
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<img src="img/31st2.png" title="31st Century Fox Twin" alt="31st Century Fox Twin" align="left"><h3>31st Century Fox Twin</h3>Look familiar? This here is the twin of the 31st Century Fox (though only in Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge - In other games, it's apparently the same one you met back in Space Station Meer. Kinda weird if you defeated him with the Plasma weapons, but okay, sure). He hasn't learnt his lesson at all thankfully, so you can re-use all the techniques you used to defeat him in his intergalactic retreat. If you skipped that part, read up a bit further and check out the strategy for him. It works the same here, only you're still on a 60 second time limit so only use powerful weapons to blast him outta there and take the key to the next cage.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<img src="img/odebah.png" title="Odebah Bear" alt="Odebah Bear" align="left"><h3>Odebah Bear</h3>Meet the General's spiritual advisor, Odebah. His design varies a little in Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge where even the fur on his left side is pure white. That doesn't change his attack pattern though, which is limited to a Close Attack only. When he's near enough, he will thrust his mechanical claw-hand into the Fur Fighter and twist it around. Sounds painful, right? Apparently it is, because this will cause major damage to be applied to your character. Thankfully he will pause before he enacts his painful attack, giving any Fur Fighter a chance to leg it and attack from a distance. Since you're only given 60 seconds to defeat this guy as well, better stock up on those heavy hitters and slam him against a cage door. Once defeated, snag the 3rd Cage Key, since Oddfelt still remains.
<br /><br /><br />

<img src="img/oddfelt.png" title="Oddfelt" alt="Oddfelt" align="left"><h3>Oddfelt</h3>Finally! The final mini boss found in Viggo's Vault. With another 60 seconds to do so, you'll have to act fast yet again, though if you haven't already fluffed it and restarted from the last mini boss, you're probably incredibly low by now. This guy uses his bowler hat as a weapon. Whilst that might not sound particularly threatening, you might change your mind when he throws it in a frisbee-like fashion straight at you from a long distance. However, he'll also pause right before he does so, so take this as your chance to fire at him and cancel the attack. Get him against a cage door, and fire at him with all you've got left (which hopefully isn't Grenades or Rockets, since that won't work quite as well). With his defeat in the bag, you'll be presented with the final Cage Key, and you can rest assured there are no more mini bosses... In the Vault, at least.
<br /><br /><br />

<img src="img/grar.png" title="Mr.Grr & Mr.Arr" alt="Mr.Grr & Mr.Arr" align="left"><h3>Mr.Grr & Mr.Arr</h3>So yeah, another mini boss in Secret Island. Well, it <i>is</i> the final level of the game (besides the final boss, of course). Mr. Grr & Mr. Arr (or Mr. Grr and Mr. Argh if you're playing Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge) are a rather unique duo based off the James Bond villain. Two bears that were part of a failed experiment, they attack with Pistols inside a crazy funhouse. However, the funhouse is cursed, and only Bungalow is stupid enough not to go crazy... At least not instantly. You're given a time limit here as well, though unlike the other mini bosses you've battled, you can leap into the center of the center room and use Bungalow's high jump to smash his head against the bell which clears his head and resets the timer. There's not much new technique here, so you can safely use all the experience you would have hopefully gained by now to put a stop to them and carry on your way.
<br /><br /><br />
<img src="img/globe.png" title="Globe Droid" alt="Globe Droid" align="left"><h3>Globe Droid</h3>The final Chameleon Bot of the game can only be found in Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge. Otherwise, a hoard of Foxes want to punish you for making it this far instead. So! By now you should be pretty familiar with how this works (or if you've purposefully avoided every Bot thus far, then you might be in trouble). Much like Mr. Dustee, this earthly enemy follows you around from the sky. It also possesses a gun, much like the other Chameleon Bots, making this one the hardest of all for many. The room you're in is no bigger (or smaller) than the other rooms you've had to face these mini bosses in, so point your crosshair in the direction of the Bot, and fire at the eye. When hit, he'll recoil briefly, before re-opening and taking fire. Since he's almost always moving, you'll probably need to pay attention to its whereabouts. Sometimes you'll get lucky though - The Bot does halt all movement (except for his gunfire), and when this happens, take out your best weapon to get a clear shot at it. Once this has been taken down, one of Roofus' digging mounds will appear in the center, and you can fight another mini boss. Hurrah!<br /><br />


<img src="img/unfluffables.png" title="Unfluffables" alt="Unfluffables" align="left"><h3>Unfluffables</h3>More James Bond parodies! Well, let's cut to the chase. These (possibly mutated) creatures are quick and nimble, but they only possess a (fairly powerful) close attack. The area you'll battle these two in is large, but still deadly. Grondas are spread out, and although there's a clean pathway to the other side, you'll need to hop all over the place to get anywhere else. Since this is Roofus' trial, there are also a couple of mounds for him to dig in. Oh, and careful when crossing the bridge - Fall in and there's a Giant Shrimp waiting at the bottom. If you're playing on the Dreamcast version of the game, however, this doesn't matter since you can battle these two without him. Like most mini bosses, the easiest way to defeat them is to run away from them, shooting at them from a distance. Try to target one at a time, then focus on the other. Since Roofy is so darn slow, this can be a bit of a problem though. However, there's a common glitch here which, upon arrival, causes Roofus to become invincible. Completely. Don't ask how it works, we're not sure. You'll know if it's active, since nothing will hurt him or even cause him to flinch.<br /><br />

<img src="img/fifi.png" title="Fifi" alt="Fifi" align="left"><h3>Fifi</h3>Oh look! Yet another mini boss! This time it's the horrible little man that General Viggo loves so dearly. You'll be glad to know this is the last mini boss in the game. You'll be not so glad to know that he's also arguably the hardest mini boss of all, if only because this guy happens to have a OHKO (OHF?) laser which can catch Tweek if he's not careful. Well, let's start this frustrating mini boss by running up the nearby outercircle ramp, trying our best not to get hit by the carrier's hoard of weapons. Always keep running - There's no time to pause on this one. Aim for the rectangular thrusters on either side, and keep blasting them until they blow up. As you move up the ramp, you'll notice that Fifi will rise with you, so again, don't pause if you can help it. Once that's done, there's also a thruster at the bottom which needs taking care of, so you might need to drop down to get a good shot at it. Remember that Fifi will fall with you, so you might need to run back up the ramp as fast as you can to get ahead of him. If you're at the bottom, remember you can always stock up on Pet Yums and ammo here. Once this bottom thruster has been blown off, the carrier will fall to the bottom. Run up the circular ramp, and from the top, glide down to the center of the aircraft, and blow up the open container with grenades. Fifi will finally be defeated, leaving you to take on the big cat himself. Alternative way to beat this mini boss - Hope the invincibility glitch from the Unfluffables has carried over to Tweek (which it sometimes does) and defeat him at your own leisure.<br /><br /><br />
